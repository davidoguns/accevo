/*********************************************************************
	The purpose of this file is to be globally included in a project.
	It is to facilitate control over global aspects of all header and
	source files in a project without having to modify every one directly.
	
	This should not be used to control any project specific behavior
	globally in a project, but rather the more technical underlying
	aspects of the C runtime - i.e. overriding new/delete globally.
